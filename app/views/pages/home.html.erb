<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>This site is a resource and chronicle of my foray into career-transitioning, single-parenting, surviving, and becoming an entrepreneur.  I've decided to share my story and the resources I have found along the way because I know you are out there.  You walk amongst us...you are the people who shuttle themselves through socially acceptable jobs in spite of a secret longing and pull to the "what if..."  You've been punching the clock on life for so long that real freedom and creative fulfillment seem an impossible proposition.  I was one of you for so long, and I've met many of you along the way.  I want you to know that I see you.  Don't give up on your dreams, or yourself.  It's never too late to take your life back.  It's never too late to learn.  It's never too late to take a leap of faith.
